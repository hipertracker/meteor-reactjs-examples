# meteor-reactjs-examples

Examples of using [hipertracker:meteor-reactjs](https://github.com/hipertracker/meteor-reactjs)

## Usage
```
$ git clone https://github.com/hipertracker/meteor-reactjs-examples
$ cd meteor-reactjs-examples/examples/leaderboard
$ meteor
```

The leaderboard example is based on [that code](https://github.com/reactjs/react-meteor/tree/master/examples/leaderboard) but it's upgraded to new Meteor and new JSX syntax, with enabled ES6 transforms.
